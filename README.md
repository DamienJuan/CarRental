### **Setup**

So that it is easier for us to test your project.

### Problem

*What problem does your project solve? How does it fit into the theme "Building a Decentralized Future"?*

### Solution

*How did you resolve this issue? What technologies did you use? What was your biggest technical challenge and how does your solution solve it?*

### Team and comments

*Specify the name of your team (the same as on the discord/gather), and tell us what you learned during this hackathon!*

### Project Submission

- Provide an explanation of the features of your projects. You must link a demonstration video with commentary and screen recording of your presentation (10 slides max) or demo product (example: Loom, 4 minutes max).
- Include a brief demonstration of the use of **Starton** or its partners **iExec**, **BNB Chain**, **NodeReal,** or **Ledger**.
The more you use partner technologies, the more points you will earn. Example: Use the **Starton** API on the **BNB Chain** blockchain.
You have used two partners.
