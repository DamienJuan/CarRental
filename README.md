# CryptoCar

### **Setup**

### Problem

This simplifies the need to rent luxury cars with cryptocurrency.

It helps to move towards a decentralized future since the transaction is based on the blockchain and without the need of external human interaction for the payment.

### Solution

We propose a simple interface to rent cars for a day or more, you pay when you return it with BNB Chain using metamask.

### Team and comments

Team Name : SoloBolo (indeed I was alone).

Before this Hackathon I didn't really have any knowledge on Web3 and blockchain, that's why I did a very simple concept oriented towards E-Society and payment methods.

I learned a lot by following course, I learned how to code in Solidity, made my first smart contract and deployed it with Hardhat (sorry Starton i'm too noob for the techno) on the BSC Testnet , then I did the front end with React + Vite and linked all that together to interact with my contract through metamask and the UI.

This hackathon allowed me to introduce myself to the world of Web3 and to understand a little about how it works.
